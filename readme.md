# Sliding website image example

Vanilla JS script test to emulate scrolling a website when hovering over a picture

**_onmouseover_** runs a script to calulate the pixel difference between the viewing window and the image height and adjusts the margin of the image with a transition effect to emulate scrolling.

**_onmouseout_** runs a sript to return image to its original position. Also speeds up the transition from 0.7s to 0.1s for UX.
